Future changes to the code:

- better error handling

- execute a script (beyond cleanup) when all the jobs are done running

- safe eval?? (for the moment, the final expressions must have numbers and/or elementary operators
but no standard functions...maybe the math library would be ok)

- doc

- show cluster jobs not in exit status if successful

- find catchy name

- pythia 8!

- better editing of the param card: organize by blocks and IDS for each block

- fix issue with regexp in output file names
