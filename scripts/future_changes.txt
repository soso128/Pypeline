Future changes to the code:

- be able to run same parameter set several times (be careful with the seed)

- better error handling

- execute a script (beyond cleanup) when all the jobs are done running

- safe eval?? (for the moment, the final expressions must have numbers and/or elementary operators
but no standard functions...maybe the math library would be ok)

- doc

- show cluster jobs not in exit status if successful

- find catchy name

- pythia 8!

- write a configure script to find: cluster parameters, python executables, madgraph, etc... --> modify env file with desired executables
