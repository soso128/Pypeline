Future changes to the code:

- take gridpacks

- better error handling

- scripts that execute after all the subprocesses have ran (cleanup,etc...)

- safe eval?? (for the moment, the final expressions must have numbers and/or elementary operators
but no standard functions...maybe the math library would be ok)

- doc

- separate executable

- show cluster jobs not in exit status if successful

- find catchy name

- pythia 8!
